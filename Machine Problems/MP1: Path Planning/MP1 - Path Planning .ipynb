    "**Problem Definition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the starting and goal point, we are tasked to know the shortest solution path between those two points using the Depth-First Search Algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Structures**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use two data structures:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   (1) *path* is a dictionary to know the parent of the given node.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   (2) *visited* is a queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "   (3) *fringe* is a priority queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**We proceed to the process:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.we put the starting node in the fringe with priority 0\n",
    "\n",
    "2.we explore while the fringe still has nodes\n",
    "   \n",
    "3.so we pop the first element of the fringe which has the highest priority\n",
    "   \n",
    "4.put this to the expanded node\n",
    "  \n",
    "5.We check if the node that is expanded is the goal. We stop if it is and if not, we continue\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Since it's not the goal node, we look to its children\n",
    "that is if the node is not in the fringe, we append it\n",
    "to the fringe. \n",
    "\n",
    "7.Since in working with dfs, the fringe does the trick, we assign the priority depending on the depth of the node. We put the negative sign so that we consider them first as this is dfs. \n",
    "This also let us not use anymore the parent dictionary. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristic Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "We tried using three heuristic functions, the Manhattan distance heuristic, the Diagonal distance heuristic, and the Chebychev distance heuristic. \n",
    "\n",
    "From these and our explorations with these, we decided to simply use the Diagonal distance heuristic, as it is the most easily visible estimate of the distance between two points in a 2D space, as this is the actual distance between the points, when permitting diagonal movement from point to point.\n",

    "The Manhattan distance heuristic on the other hand is appropriate when disallowing diagonal movement from point to point.\n",

    "   (1) an atomic *cell* structure which represents points in our maze. A cell notes relational (parent) and positional information of a node, along with the capacity to store cost, heuristic, and total cost (all initialized to 0, but to be incrementally reinitiallized for each run of our algorithm)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   (2) a *priority queue* like list, from which we pop the node of least cost with each iteration of the algorithm\n",

    "    \n",

    "<img src=\"Analysis1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of the first test case is to see the raw behavior of algorithms such that there are no obstacles on its path. Shockingly, the first one to arrived to the goal given the actual running time is the BFS implementation with only ~0.00214 seconds. However compared to to A*’s ~0.00249 seconds, we can see the difference between node expansion and cost of solution. The BFS having 11 nodes in the solution vs the 10 nodes of the A* in the solution which is not that much of a difference; however, the big difference is seen in terms of their expanded nodes with the BFS having 441 nodes compared to the 11 node expansion of A*. The one which ranked last given it’s behavior of almost brute forcing each row is the DFS amounting the actual running time of ~0.4880 seconds, having both the cost of the solution and expanded nodes to be 2001.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here we can see the blind nature of the first two searches, which both simply iterate through the entire search space, albeit in different directions. In this case, the goal state was in the favor of BFS, but this is simply because of how BFS is implemented as it goes to the breadth first. In contrast, A* can be seen to go directly in the direction of its goal state, but its deliberate nature cannot be fully appreciated in this simple case.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a better appreciation of A*’s deliberate nature, we may move on to the next test case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Case #2: Big Obstacles with the Goal Near the Left\n",
    "<img src=\"Analysis2.png\">\n",
    "This maze highlights a case where BFS’ blind search would be in favor of its efficiency. The level order nature in which BFS traverses nodes of its search tree allows the algorithm to quickly seek a goal point which is found to the relative lower left of its starting point. This is at the cost though of a massive traversal of the search space, which is over 4 magnitudes (10^4) greater than that of DFS, and 5 magnitudes (10^5) greater than that of A*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, this would not be beneficial to DFS’ nature of preorder traversal, which would require it to traverse and extend the depth of its search space to reach a goal state in the same relative position. This can be seen in how the depth of the search is blindly extended throughout almost a third of the search space before DFS is able to reach its goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search order traversal is not a hindrance on the other hand to A* search, which is immediately able to align its search in the relative direction of its goal state. Once it hits an obstacle shape, it appropriately adjusts its direction to avoid such obstacle, but as soon as such is out of the search direction space, the direction of the search is promptly directed once again to that of its goal state. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Case #3: Big Obstacles with the Goal Near the Right\n",
    "<img src=\"Analysis3.png\">\n",
    "The solution path for BFS is once again relatively short, compared to DFS, but at the expense of a massive search of the search space, which is almost 2 magnitudes (100) greater than that of DFS. In contrast, DFS’s traversal is more quickly determine the location of the given goal state, but the solution path from such search is evidently more costly (over 10 times more costly) than that of BFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "A* once again trumps both other blind algorithms, with significantly fewer node expansions, and a in only slightly more time than DFS. While DFS extends its depth exponentially to avoid obstacle shapes, A* simply adjusts its path minutely to avoid such, allowing the least admissible amount of deviation from the direction of its goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Case #4:  Multiple Small Obstacles \n",
    "<img src=\"Analysis4.png\">\n",
    "Done with testing with large multiple obstacles, we see what if there are small multiple obstacles, especially with different choices of paths to go to the goal point set below in the middle. \n",
    "\n",
    "As seen, even though the DFS harnessed the most cost in the solution and most number of expanded nodes, it triumphed to be the fastest to reach the goal. The second one that reached the goal is A* with only 128 cost in its solution vs its 757 expanded nodes. Lastly, given BFS’ behavior of doing breadth first and the environment set-up, it is much expected that it would come last as it harnessed ~127.59 seconds before reaching the goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Test Case #5:  Precision goal with obstacle\n",
    "<img src=\"Analysis5.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this last set-up, the objective is having large obstacles but the goal is in a narrow part. \n",
    "This time despite BFS’ and A*’s competition to be the fastest, A* won this time. It looked like the same as BFS given the figures; however, seeing them more clearly, even though A* won, it harnessed more nodes in its solution path and expanded nodes than BFS. As always, DFS’ brute forcing behavior led it to ~16 seconds, also having the largest cost in its solution and number of expanded nodes.\n",
