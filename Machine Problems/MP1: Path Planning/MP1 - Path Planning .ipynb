    "#### Data Structures\n",
    "We use two data structures:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   (1) *parent* is a dictionary to know the parent of the given node.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   (2) *fringe* is a queue.\n",

    "#### We proceed to the process:\n",
    "1.we append the starting node to the fringe\n",
    "\n",
    "2.we explore while the fringe still has nodes\n",
    "   \n",
    "3.so we pop the first element of the fringe\n",
    "   \n",
    "4.put this to the expanded node\n",
    "**Note:** we enable duplicates with the nodes such that an explored node may still be considered\n",
    "  \n",
    "5.We check if the node that is expanded is the goal. We stop if it is and if not, we continue\n",
    "   \n",
    "6.Since it's not the goal node, we look to its children\n",
    "that is if the node is not in the fringe, we append it\n",
    "to the fringe. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Caution! The Nature of Starting and Goal Point\n",
    "However, we need to consider the nature of starting and goal point in telling who's the parent and who's the child for backtracking purposes later to get the solution path if we reached the goal. \n",
    "     \n",
    "So if the start point is found above or in the same row as the goal point, we will only assign the parent-child relationship such that only those who are in the higher rows or\n",

    "On the other hand, if the start point is found below or in the same row as the goal point,\n",

    "Since we are considering graphs, it is possible to have cycles. If we do not include those conditions, there will come a time that the above node can parent the below and the below can parent the above, thus if we backtrack say (3,0) is the parent of (4,0), then it would ask, who is the parent of (3,0) then we will find that it is (4,0) and it will just loop forever--which we do not want to happen.\n",
